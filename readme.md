# Testing Backbone.js with mocha

This is an example demo for a [blog post](http://phawk.co.uk/articles/testing-backbone-with-mocha) phawk has written.

I've forked it to experiment with. To get started:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the npm modules: `npm install`
3. Install grunt if you don't already have it: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. Start the watcher to execute tests upon file update: `grunt`
